# **US States Quiz**
## About
This project is a quiz game developed in Python, utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, as well as the Pandas and Turtle modules. It tests the user's knowledge about the geography of the USA by letting them guess all the 50 states.

## Game Instructions:
Enter the names of the US states. When a correct US state name is entered, it shows the location of the state on the map of the USA. The game ends when the user is able to guess all 50 states. To force the game to end, enter ```Exit```. For learning purposes, the names of the states that the user failed to guess are stored in the ```states_to_learn.csv``` file for the user to learn about the remaining states.
